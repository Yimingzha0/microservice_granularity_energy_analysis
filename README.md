# The Impact of Granularity on Energy Consumption and Performance in Microservice-based Systems Scripts
These are the script datasets of the experiments: the Impact of Granularity on Energy Consumption and Performance in Microservice-based Systems

## Two systems 
For the two systems, [train ticket system](https://github.com/Yimingzha0/train-ticket-microservice) [pet clinic system](https://github.com/Yimingzha0/petclinic-microservices)  
Three different granularity of the system can be found in the different branches.
